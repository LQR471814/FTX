### Building

You will need

- Node / npm cli
- Go
- gRPC + Protobuf tools

Building everything can now be done in one command
`node build.js`
but requires you have everything setup already

You can also build specific components of the app individually

`node build.js <action 'frontend' | 'rpc' | 'backend' | 'distribution'>`
